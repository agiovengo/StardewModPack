The default Easter Bunny mod has Easter Bunnies available to purchase in Marnie's shop.

If you want to remove Easter Bunnies from the shop (recommended!), so you can only get them if you find and incubate their eggs, then replace the contents of "content.json" with all the text in "content-noshop.txt".  If you change your mind and want to switch back, you can replace the text in "content.json" with the text in "content-inshop.txt".

Easter Eggs can be found in the Secret Woods every Spring 11-13.
